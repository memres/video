It has been firstly created in 2006 in just a few hours as a course project. Initial version was a single page embedding live television channels. In time this thing has turned into an online theater by containing hundreds of movies and episodes of popular series. Via the latest version of the project which is completely renovated in 2017, billions of <b>YouTube</b> videos can be reached hassle free, even if it is blocked at your location. You can list videos with user friendly search options, and also under various categories pregenerated for easy access. Watch unlimited videos without ads having <b>AutoPlay</b> and <b>Continuous Playing</b> buttons enabled. Last but not least, there is an extra feature YouTube still does not have that you may jump to a <b>random</b> video by a single click whenever you feel lucky.
